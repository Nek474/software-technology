Introduction
Welcome to our Data Analysis and Visualization App!

In today's data-driven world, making sense of large datasets and extracting valuable insights is crucial for decision-making in various domains such as business, healthcare, finance, and more. However, analyzing and understanding complex data can be challenging without the right tools and techniques.

Our application aims to simplify the process of exploring, analyzing, and visualizing tabular data by providing a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, a popular Python library for building interactive web applications. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or enthusiast, our app offers a range of features to help you gain deeper insights into your datasets.

Key Features:
Upload Data: Easily upload your CSV or Excel files to start analyzing your data.

2D Visualization: Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

Classification: Explore different classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Random Forest, and evaluate their performance on your dataset.

Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms like k-Means and DBSCAN to discover patterns and groupings within your data.

Interactive Interface: Navigate through different tabs seamlessly and interact with visualizations to gain deeper insights.

Our application is designed to empower users with the tools they need to unlock the potential of their data, enabling informed decision-making and driving innovation. Whether you're a seasoned data professional or just getting started with data analysis, we invite you to explore and discover the possibilities with our Data Analysis and Visualization App.
